# Arcade_game_tic-tac-toe

ABOUT: Tic-Tac-Toe game leveraging DOM (document object model) to create a responsive interface for users. Game switches players upon each click of the gameboard. Game ends once one player gets three of their pieces in a row or if they tie. To restart the game all you have to do is click the button at the bottom of the page. 

PROS: Was very pleased with my ability to resolve the game logic and create a functional game without any console errors. Also pleased with the functionality of the buttons, allowing for players to restart the game without refreshing the page itself.

CONS: Wanted to create a form that allows players to enter their names before the game and assign them to an X or an O but could not work out the logic. Also wanted to create a score board that stores the wins for past games, but came to the same roadblock as the form. Have been looking into how to resolve these issues and want to update once I get some more freetime from class/ other assigments.
